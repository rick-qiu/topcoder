     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p> Little Lisa has been invited to a holiday party with her friends. So that everyone receives a gift, the host of the party has decided to give presents through a &quot;Yankee swap&quot;. </p><p> In this version of a Yankee swap (which may differ from the version that you are used to), each person begins holding a present; the first person (indexed from 1) holds present 'A', the second person holds present 'B', etc. Each guest in turn (starting with guest 1 and ending with guest N) decides whether or not he wants to swap presents. If he decides to swap, he chooses a person to swap with, and the chosen person cannot reject the swap. When every person has had a turn, the Yankee swap is over, and each person leaves with the gift they are holding. </p><p> For example, one way that the party (with 3 people) could proceed is as follows: </p> <pre>
&quot;ABC&quot; --&gt; Person 1 swaps with person 2 --&gt; &quot;BAC&quot;
&quot;BAC&quot; --&gt; Person 2 does not swap       --&gt; &quot;BAC&quot;
&quot;BAC&quot; --&gt; Person 3 swaps with person 2 --&gt; &quot;BCA&quot;
</pre> <p> In the above example, person 1 leaves with present B, person 2 leaves with present C, and person 3 leaves with present A. </p><p> The guests at the party have given you their <b>preferences</b>, where the i-th element corresponds to the preference list of the i-th guest. If a guest ends up with the gift in the j-th position of his preference list, he will have an unhappiness of j. Each guest knows the <b>preferences</b> of all other guests. Each guest will act optimally to minimize his own unhappiness, and knows all other guests will do the same. If there are multiple ways for a guest to minimize his own unhappiness, he will choose not to swap at all if possible; if there are still multiple ways, he will choose to swap with the guest with the lowest index. </p><p> Return a String, the i-th character of which corresponds to the turn of the i-th person. If the i-th person did not swap in his turn, the i-th character of the result must be equal to '-'. If he did swap with the k-th person, the i-th character of the result must be equal to the k-th lowercase letter (so, 'a' corresponds to swapping with the first person, 'b' to the second and so on). </p></td>
