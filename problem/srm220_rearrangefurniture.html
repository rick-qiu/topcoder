     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p>Kawigi's furniture is all in the wrong places in his new apartment. He needs to move all of it into the appropriate spots. The problem is that he has so much furniture and very limited room to move it in. Because of this, the only action he can take to rearrange his furniture is to swap two pieces of furniture.</p> <p>He would like to exert as little physical effort as possible in doing this task, where the effort of swapping two pieces of furniture is defined as the sum of the weights of the two objects to be swapped. You need to figure out what the minimum effort required to put all of the furniture in the correct places.</p> <p>You will be given two int[]s, the first is the weights of each piece of furniture (element 0 of the int[] will be the weight of furniture 0, element 1 will be the weight of furniture 1, etc). The second int[] is the location where each piece of furniture is supposed to end up (furniture 0 starts out in location 0, furniture 1 starts out in location 1, etc). You are to find and return the minimum cost required to put the furniture in their rightful locations.</p></td>
