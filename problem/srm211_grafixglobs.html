     <td><p> <i><b>Note:</b> This problem statement includes images that may not appear if you are using a plugin. For best results, use the Arena editor.</i> </p> <p> In the vector-drawing mode of the grafix software package, the user plots geometric <i>objects</i> of three kinds: arcs, circles, and polygons. These objects are grouped into collections known as <i>globs</i>. A newly made object automatically belongs to a glob of which it is the sole member. The user can later choose to merge two globs into one, or to split one glob so that each of its objects is delegated to a glob on its own. Each glob bears a unique identification number or ID, which is crucial to updating the document. Your job is to take a sequence of drawing instructions expressed in the grafix internal language, and execute them according to the rules laid out below. </p> <p> An instruction is a string that takes one the following forms. </p> <pre>
  make OBJ
  delete ID
  merge ID ID
  split ID
</pre> <p> In these forms, &quot;OBJ&quot; is a placeholder for one of the following values. </p> <pre>
  arc
  circle
  polygon
</pre> <p> Furthermore, &quot;ID&quot; is a placeholder for the string representation of an existing glob ID, which must be a non-negative integer. The string representation will not be padded with zeros, and no instruction will be padded with extraneous spaces on either side or between its tokens. </p> <p> Before you execute the first instruction, the document is empty, so no glob IDs are in use. When a &quot;make&quot; instruction is executed, you must form a new glob whose ID is the lowest non-negative integer that isn't currently in use as a glob ID. The sole member of the new glob will be an object of the type named by the &quot;make&quot; instruction. </p> <p> To execute a &quot;delete&quot; instruction, you take the glob whose ID is specified by the instruction, discard all the objects it contains, and liberate its ID for future use. </p> <p> The &quot;merge&quot; instruction specifies two different IDs. The first one identifies the <i>target</i> glob, to which you must add the members of the second glob, called the <i>source</i> glob. Immediately thereafter, the source glob is to be destroyed and its ID liberated. Note that globs do not contain other globs, but only objects. Thus, the consequence of a merge operation is that the target glob contains more objects than before, namely its prior contents as well as the objects drawn from the source glob. </p> <p> The &quot;split&quot; instruction liberates the ID of the specified glob and then reassigns each of its member objects to an individual glob bearing the lowest available ID, in the following order. First the arcs are reassigned, then the circles, and finally the polygons. The specified glob is finally discarded. Its ID, if it was not reused by one of its member objects, remains available. </p> <p> You are given a sequence of drawing instructions in the String[] <b>commands</b>. After executing all instructions in order, you are to determine the contents of the glob whose ID is specified by the int <b>sel</b>. If there is no such glob, return an empty int[]. Otherwise, return an int[] with three values declaring, in order, the number of arcs, circles, and polygons in that glob. </p> </td>
