     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>You are interested in purchasing items from a number of stores in a local market. The market is composed of <b>N</b> stores numbered from 0 to <b>N</b>-1. The stores with numbers from 0 to M-1 are interesting to you and all the other stores are not interesting. Some pairs of stores are connected by roads. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>interestingStores</b> which contains M elements and describes the interesting stores. The i-th element corresponds to store i and is formatted &quot;OPEN CLOSE DURATION&quot; (quotes for clarity), where OPEN is the opening time (in seconds), CLOSE is the closing time (in seconds) and DURATION is the time (in seconds) required to make a purchase in this store. You can initiate a purchase from a store at any time T between OPEN and CLOSE, inclusive. In order to do so, you need to arrive to the store at time T (or earlier). The purchase will be finalized at time T + DURATION and you need to stay at the store for the entire duration of your purchase. Note that it is possible for a purchase to end when the store is already closed. You cannot make multiple purchases in the same store. <br /><br /><br /><br /> The roads are given by the String[] <b>roads</b>. Each element of <b>roads</b> describes a single bidirectional road and is formatted &quot;A B LENGTH&quot; (quotes for clarity). Here A and B are the numbers of stores connected by the road and LENGTH is the time (in seconds) required to move from A to B (or from B to A) using this road. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Your start at time 0 at the location of store <b>N</b>-1. Return the maximum number of purchases in interesting stores that you can make.</td>
