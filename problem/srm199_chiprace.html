     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p> Poker tournaments are usually played with chips of various denominations. For the purpose of this problem, assume that $5 and $25 chips are in play. At a predetermined time in the tournament, the $5 chips are removed from play and traded up for the equivalent value of $25 chips. For example, if a player has ten $5 chips, these would be replaced by two $25 chips. This is fine, as long as the number of $5 chips held by each player is a multiple of 5. However, it is likely that players will have a few chips left over after trading in their $5 chips in multiples of 5. These remaining chips are called &quot;odd chips&quot;, and there are several way to deal with these. One method is to hold a &quot;chip race&quot;. </p> <p> To begin the chip race, the dealer determines the total number of $25 chips that will be awarded, by counting all the odd chips and dividing by 5 (rounding to the nearest integer). Then, the deck of cards is shuffled, and each player receives one card face up for each of his odd chips. The player with the highest card on the table is awarded one $25 chip, and then his cards are collected and removed. Then, the player with the <i>highest card remaining</i> is awarded the next $25 chip (if there are more than one), and his cards are collected and removed. This is repeated until all of the $25 chips have been awarded. Note that each player can win at most one $25 chip. </p> <p> A standard deck consists of 52 cards, with 13 values and 4 suits. This is not important for this problem. Assume that the deck of cards consists of 52 unique cards, numbered 1 through 52. </p> <p> For example, if there are five players, with 2, 3, 1, 0, and 2 odd chips, and if they are dealt the following cards: </p> <pre>

    player  odd chips  cards
    ------  ---------  -------
    1       2          49, 35
    2       3          2, 24, 4
    3       1          27
    4       0
    5       2          3, 15
</pre> <p> The total number of odd chips is 8, so two $25 chips would be awarded. Player 1 has the highest card (a 49), and would receive the first $25 chip. After his cards are removed, player 3 has the highest remaining card (a 27), and would receive the second $25 chip. Notice that even though player 1 initially had the first <i>and</i> second highest card, he still is only awarded a single chip. Players 2, 4, and 5 receive nothing. </p> <p> Curious players may question the fairness of this technique. You are to answer such questions by writing a method to compute each player's probability of winning a chip in the chip race. You will be given a int[] <b>chips</b>, which contains the number of odd chips held by each player, and are to return a double[] with each player's probability of winning a chip. The returned double[] should have the same number of elements as <b>chips</b>, and element <i>i</i> of the returned double[] should correspond to element <i>i</i> of <b>chips</b>. </p></td>
