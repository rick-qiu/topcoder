     <td>You are downloading some files from the Internet, and you want to know how long it will take until they are completely downloaded.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> For each download, you are given its current speed (in KB/s) and remaining time based on that speed (in seconds). The sum of all the speeds is your total bandwidth, which remains constant and is utilized fully at all times during the downloads. This means that when files finish downloading, the newly available bandwidth is distributed among the remaining files. The way it's distributed does not affect the final answer.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> For example, consider the following scenario where you are downloading two files.<br /><br /> 1) Speed = 3 KB/s Remaining Time 57 seconds<br /><br /> 2) Speed = 2 KB/s Remaining Time 22 seconds<br /><br /> <br /><br /> After 22 seconds, the second file will finish downloading. The first file still has 35 seconds remaining, but that time is based on the original speed. The bandwidth freed up by the second file is now allocated to the first file, and its new speed is 3+2=5 KB/s. The new remaining time is: Old_Remaining_Time * Old_Speed / New_Speed = 35*3/5 = 21 seconds.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> So the actual remaining time for all the files is 21+22=43 seconds.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> You will be given a String[] <b>tasks</b>, each element of which represents a single file being downloaded. Each file is represented as two positive integers with no leading zeroes, separated by a single space. The first integer is the current download speed in KB/s and the second integer is the remaining time in seconds based on the current speed. Return a double representing the remaining time in seconds for all the downloads to finish.</td>

The new speeds and remaining times for those files will be:<br /><br /> 20 KB/s and remaining time 2000 seconds<br /><br /> 20 KB/s and remaining time 1000 seconds<br /><br />Those would take 1500 seconds to complete.
