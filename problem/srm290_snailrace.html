     <td><p> George wanted to arrange a race for his snail farm. He put all his snails on the starting line, shouted &quot;GO!&quot;, and started watching the exciting race. </p> <p> After an hour or two, he realized that snails are good tacticians. All of them were running at the same constant speed of <b>snailSpeed</b> meters per hour, probably saving strength for a rapid finish in the last meter. With <b>distance</b> meters remaining until the finish line, he decides to speed up the race and help his little friends by carrying each of them closer to the end. He needs to be careful, so he decides to carry only one snail at a time. George can walk <b>georgeSpeed</b> meters per hour. To keep the race fair, all the snails need to be moved by the same distance, and of course, all of them need to be transported before any of them reaches one meter from the finish line. </p> <p> You are given four ints: <b>snails</b>, the number of snails, <b>distance</b>, the distance in meters remaining until the finish line, <b>snailSpeed</b>, the speed of each snail in meters per hour, and <b>georgeSpeed</b>, George's walking speed in meters per hour. Compute the shortest possible time (in hours) after which all the snails will be one meter from the finish line.</p> </td>
