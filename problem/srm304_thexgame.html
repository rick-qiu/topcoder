     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>The X game is a two person game. The board is just a sequence of boxes, some of which are randomly marked with an X before the game begins. The two players alternate turns. On each turn the player whose turn it is marks 1 or more previously unmarked boxes. All her marks on the turn must be adjacent (with no wrap-around at the ends) to each other. The game continues until all the boxes are marked. <p> The number of points scored by a player on his turn is equal to the number of boxes he marked on that turn times a multiplier. The multiplier gets bigger and bigger as the game goes on:</p>
      <ul>
       <li> first turn Player 1 multiplier=0</li>
       <li> second turn Player 2 multiplier=1</li>
       <li> third turn Player 1 multiplier=2</li>
       <li> fourth turn Player 2 multiplier=4</li>
       <li> fifth turn Player 1 multiplier=8</li>
       <li> ... etc.</li>
      </ul> A players wins the game if the sum of the points scored on all her turns is strictly greater than her opponent's sum. Create a class TheXGame that contains a method firstMove that is given a String <b>board</b> indicating how many boxes there are, and which ones are marked with X before the game begins. The method returns the smallest number of Xs that the first player can mark on her first turn (somewhere on the board) that will allow her to win the game if she plays optimally thereafter. If no first move puts the first player into a winning position, the method returns -1. </td>
