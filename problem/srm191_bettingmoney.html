     <td>You run a gambling business in which people place bets on the margin of victory in a football game. At the end of the day, the company would like to know what the day's net gain has been.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Just as in any other betting system, people place certain amounts as their bets and if they guess correctly, they get their money back plus a pre-specified percentage of their bet; otherwise they lose the money they bet. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a int[], <b>amounts</b>, the i<sup>th</sup> element of which is the number of dollars people have placed on a victory margin of i (i = 0 refers to the first element). You are also given a int[], <b>centsPerDollar</b>, the i<sup>th</sup> element of which is the number of cents the company has to pay for every dollar the people bet on a victory margin of i, if the final outcome is a victory margin of i. Finally, you are given an int, <b>finalResult</b>, which is the final margin of victory. You have to determine what the net gain for the day was and return the amount in cents.<br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, if <b>amounts</b> were {10,20,30}, it would mean that people placed $10 on a draw outcome, $20 on a victory margin of 1 and $30 on a victory margin of 2, and if <b>centsPerDollar</b> were {20,30,40}, it would mean the people would win 20 cents per dollar bet if the match were a draw, 30 cents per dollar if the victory margin were 1 and 40 cents per dollar if the victory margin were 2. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Suppose the final result is a victory margin of 1 (i.e., <b>finalResult</b> = 1). Then the people who guessed the outcome as a margin of 0 or 2 were wrong and the company receives the amounts they bet, $10+$30. However, the people who guessed that the outcome would be a margin of 1 were correct, and they receive money from the company according to the amount they bet (20 dollars) and the pre-set payoff percentage (30 cents per dollar) . This amounts to 20*30 = 600 cents. Hence, the day's net gain is 40 dollars - 600 cents = 3400 cents. You should return 3400.</td>
