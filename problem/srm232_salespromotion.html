     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p>Your friend has recently been looking through a catalog, and has selected several items she wishes to buy. Because of a sales promotion, she has earned credit towards free or discounted products. Each item has a cost, and a point value. For her referrals, your friend has earned a certain number of points which may be redeemed for items, and a certain number of &quot;half price&quot; items. Additionally, she receives a fixed percentage discount on all other items (this is not cumulative with half-price items). All prices are rounded up after applying discounts.</p> <p>Your friend's order is subject to the following restrictions:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Each item must be purchased with points, purchased at half price, or purchased at the fixed discount rate.</li> 
       <li>Purchasing an item with points is all or nothing; you cannot, for instance, pay for an item partially with points and pay the remainder in cash.</li> 
       <li>All points must be used.</li> 
       <li>All half-price items must be used.</li> 
       <li>All items on the wishlist must be purchased.</li> 
      </ul> <p>Your friend is very excited to place her order, but is very frustrated with what she has found to be a confusing incentive system. Being frugal-minded, she wants to get everything on her wishlist at the least possible out-of-pocket expense. Knowing your enjoyment of these type of problems, she has come to you for assistance.</p> <p>You are given an int, <b>points</b>, indicating the number of points your friend must spend; an int, <b>halfPrice</b>, indicating the number of items which are to be purchased at half price; and an int, <b>discount</b>, indicating the fixed discount percentage on all remaining items. Finally, you are given a String[], <b>items</b>, indicating the list of items on your friend's wishlist. Each element of <b>items</b> will be in the form <i>&quot;pointValue price&quot;</i> (quotes added for clarity), where <i>pointValue</i> and <i>price</i> are both positive integers with no leading zeros. <i>pointValue</i> and will be between 1 and 9999, inclusive. <i>price</i> will be between 1 and 99999, inclusive. You are to return an int indicating the minimum out of pocket expense your friend must pay to get the items on her wishlist.</p> </td>
