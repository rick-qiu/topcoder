     <td><p>You ran into some trouble when playing your favorite video game. There are <b>N</b> towns on the map, numbered from 0 to <b>N</b>-1. For each pair of distinct towns, there is exactly one way to get from one to the other by following one or more roads. Your enemy has just occupied some of the towns, and your first attempt at blocking him is to remove some of the roads in order to block off communication between every pair of distinct occupied towns. You would like to do this with as little effort as possible.</p> <p>You will be given a String[] <b>roads</b> describing the roads between towns. Each element of <b>roads</b> is in the form &quot;a b e&quot; (quotes for clarity only), meaning that there is a bidirectional road between towns a and b, and the effort required to destroy the road is e. You will also be given a int[] <b>occupiedTowns</b> containing the towns occupied by your enemy. Return the minimum total effort required to destroy enough roads so that no two distinct occupied towns have a path (direct or indirect) between them.</p> </td>
