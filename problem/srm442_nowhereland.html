     <td><p>You are the king of Nowhere Land. You've recently received some big donations, so you've decided to hire more guards to protect your country. There are <b>k</b> different guarding companies in Nowhere Land. Each guarding company has agencies in various cities. If a guarding company has an agency in a city, then that company is allowed to have at most one guard working in that city. Otherwise, the company is not allowed to have any guards in that city. As long as you obey this rule, you can add as many new guards as you want. However, you cannot fire or move existing guards.</p> <p>There's one problem though. Some pairs of cities cooperate with each other and have certain requirements when hiring guards. If city A cooperates with city B, and a certain company has a guard working in city A but not city B, that is considered a conflict. For each pair of cooperating cities, each distinct company that breaks this rule counts as a conflict, so there may be multiple conflicts within a single pair of cities.</p> <p>You are given a String[] <b>cities</b>. The number of elements in <b>cities</b> is equal to the number of cities in Nowhere Land. The j-th character of the i-th element of <b>cities</b> is '1' (one) if cities i and j cooperate, and '0' (zero) otherwise. You are also given String[]s <b>guards</b> and <b>agencies</b>. The i-th element of <b>guards</b> is a space separated list of guarding companies that already have guards working in city i. The i-th element of <b>agencies</b> is a space separated list of guarding companies that have an agency in city i. Each guarding company is represented as an integer between 0 and <b>k</b>-1, inclusive. Return the minimum possible number of conflicts that can exist after hiring additional guards.</p></td>
