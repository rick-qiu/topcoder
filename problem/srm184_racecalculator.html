     <td>If a runner races a distance D in time T, and later races a distance 2D, that runner will likely take more than 2T time to finish it. An examination of how times change with distances for a given runner can lead to the following approximation for the time it will take that runner to finish a given distance. Given two races with distances D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>1</sub>&lt;D<sub>2</sub>) which a runner ran in times T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>1</sub>&lt;T<sub>2</sub>) , respectively, the approximate time it will take a runner to run a distance D is given by: T<sub>1</sub>*e^(ln(T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>)*ln(D<sub>1</sub>/D)/ln(D<sub>1</sub>/D<sub>2</sub>)). <br /><br /><br /><br /> While it is clear which of a runner's races for a given distance is the best (the one that he or she ran the fastest), it isn't so clear what race is the best over all distances. This equation can help give an objective measure of that, however. If a runner has raced distances of D<sub>1</sub>...D<sub>n</sub>, with corresponding times of T<sub>1</sub>...T<sub>n</sub>, then any pair of two distances with their times will be able to approximate the rest of the times with the equation from above. Any other time will have a percent error from this approximation given by (actualTime-expectedTime)/expectedTime. Take the highest percent error for a time over all possible approximations, and this is that race's 'badness'. The race with the lowest badness is considered the best race. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Create a class RaceCalculator with a method bestRace that takes a int[] <b>distances</b> and a int[] <b>times</b> and returns an int that is the index of the best race specified by the input. Each value in <b>distances</b> will correspond to the value in <b>times</b> of the same index. All distances are in meters and all times are in seconds.</td>
