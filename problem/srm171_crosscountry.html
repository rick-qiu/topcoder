     <td>You are the coach of a high school cross country team. You are hosting a cross country meet at your school this weekend, and you need to be ready to score the meet. Since it is a bit of a pain to do by hand, especially for large meets, you are going to write a program to do it for you. Given the number of teams and the order in which the runners finish, determine the order in which each team places.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Capital letters will represent the teams in <b>finishOrder</b> and in the return value. The first team is 'A', the second team is 'B', and so on. The place in which the five fastest runners on a team finish is added together (first place=1, second place=2, etc...), and that is the team's score (a team must have at least five runners finish to place). Lower scores beat higher scores, and in the event of a tie the sixth fastest runners of each team are compared, and the team whose sixth fastest runner finished earlier wins the tie. If two teams tie and only one has a sixth runner, that team wins the tie. If two teams tie and neither has a sixth runner, the team who's letter comes first alphabetically wins the tie.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You will be given an int, <b>numTeams</b>, which is the number of teams competing, and a String, <b>finishOrder</b>, which is the order in which the runners finish. You are to return a String that lists the teams in the order they placed in the meet. If a team has fewer than 5 runners finish, do not include it in the return value.<br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, if <b>finishOrder</b>=&quot;AABBABBABBA&quot;, then team A's runners finish 1st, 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th, for a team score of 27 points. Team B's runners finish 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th, for a team score of 29 points (notice that only team B's first 5 runners are scored). In this case the return value would be &quot;AB&quot;.</td>
