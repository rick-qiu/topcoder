     <td>The lake where we vacation sometimes floods. As soon as the level reaches the maximum level that can be contained by the banks of the lake, the additional water covers a fixed floodplain area, which enlarges the area of the lake. Below are views of the lake from the side, with water indicated by X's. <pre>

       (not flooded)             (flooded)

</pre> The amount of evaporation depends on the surface area. When the lake is not flooded, the evaporation is <b>evapNormal</b> units of water per day. When the lake is flooded, the evaporation is <b>evapFlood</b> units per day. The lake never goes dry and never extends beyond the floodplain. <p> Assume that the lake is initially full but not flooded. Create a class WaterLevel that contains a method netAmt that is given <b>evapNormal</b>, <b>evapFlood</b>, and int[] <b>rain</b>, the amounts of rain that fell on each day during our vacation. The method returns the net increase (a positive value) or decrease (a negative value) in the units of water in the lake during our vacation. The i-th element of <b>rain</b> tells how many units of water fell during the entire i-th day. You should assume that it rains at a constant rate throughout the day. </p> </td>
