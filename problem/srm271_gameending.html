     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p>Two players play a game on a <b>n</b>*<b>n</b> chessboard. Starting with the first player, they take alternate turn putting figures on empty cells. During each turn, a player will place a figure on an empty cell in such a way that it can't be captured by any of the figures already on the board. Each figure can capture as a rook and as a knight. Rooks capture backwards, forwards, and sideways. Knights capture in an L-shape (two consecutive squares backwards, forwards, or sideways, and then one square in a perpendicular direction).</p> <p>A player wins the game when the other player cannot make a move. You are given the first moves of such a game, and you are to determine who will win if both players are trying their best to win.</p> <p>You are given a String[] <b>moves</b> representing the moves that have already been made. Each element of <b>moves</b> will be formatted as &quot;xX&quot;, where x is a lowercase letter representing the vertical position and X is a number representing the horizontal position. Return one of three possible answers:</p>
      <ul> 
       <li> &quot;First player wins&quot;, if the first player will win or has already won (there are no valid moves left, and the first player made the last move). </li> 
       <li> &quot;Second player wins&quot;, if the second player will win or has already won (there are no valid moves left, and the second player made the last move). </li> 
       <li> &quot;Invalid input&quot;, if the input is invalid (a figure is placed on a previously occupied square, or a figure can be captured by another figure). </li>
