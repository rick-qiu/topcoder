     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>A single elimination tournament consists of several rounds. In the first round, each competitor plays against one other competitor and the loser is eliminated. In the second round, each competitor that was not eliminated in the first round plays against another such competitor, and the loser is again eliminated. This process is repeated, eliminating half of the remaining competitors each round, until precisely one competitor remains. This competitor is declared the champion. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> In practice, one is often interested in ranking all the competitors in a tournament, not just the champion. Here is one way of doing this: 
      <ul> 
       <li>If competitor <i>A</i> won more games than competitor <i>B</i> did in the tournament, then <i>A</i> should be ranked higher than <i>B</i>.</li> 
       <li>If competitor <i>A</i> and competitor <i>B</i> won the same number of games in the tournament, recursively compare the ranks of the competitor <i>C</i> that eliminated <i>A</i> and the competitor <i>D</i> that eliminated <i>B</i>. Then, <i>A</i> should be ranked above <i>B</i> if and only if <i>C</i> is ranked above <i>D</i>.</li> 
      </ul> The intuition behind the second rule is that losing to a good competitor is better than losing to a bad competitor. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You must implement this scheme for ranking the competitors in a single elimination tournament. You will be given a String[] <b>names</b> and a String[] <b>lostTo</b>. The former argument gives the names of the competitors in a tournament, and the latter argument describes if and how each competitor was eliminated. Specifically, the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element of <b>lostTo</b> will be the name of the competitor that beat the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> competitor in <b>names</b>, or it will be &quot;&quot; if that competitor never lost. You should return a String[] giving the names of the competitors, sorted from highest rank to lowest rank as described above. </td>
