     <td><b>n</b> children walk around a circle with <b>n</b>-1 evenly-spaced chairs. When the music stops, each one tries to get to the nearest chair. One of them is bound to fail thus providing a lesson about life. We want to identify the loser. <p> The children start evenly spaced around the circle, with the first child, A, located right next to a chair. The child who follows A as they walk around the circle is B, the one who follows B is C, etc. The children all start walking when the music starts at a speed that will get them all the way around the circle in 10 seconds. When the music stops, they each try to get to the nearest chair. </p><p> Create a class Musical that contains a method loser that is given <b>n</b> (the number of children) and <b>time</b> (the number of seconds the music plays). The method should return the name of the loser as a String containing just one uppercase letter. </p><p> It may be helpful to note that the child who is farther from any chair than each other child is always the loser. </p> </td>
