     <td><p>Given a board consisting of empty space, walls, and the starting positions of two players A and B, determine the minimum number of turns it will take for players A and B to switch positions on the board.</p> <p>During a turn, one or both players may take a step. A step is defined as a unit movement up, down, left, right, or in any of the four diagonals. Players may not step into walls or off the board. Players may never share the same square at the end of a turn. Players may not cross paths during a turn. Crossing paths occurs when players A and B switch positions in a single turn. For example, assume player A is in the upper left corner of the board, and player B is in the square immediately to his right. Player A may not move right while player B moves left, since they would be passing each other. Player A can, however, move right if player B moves in any other direction.</p> <p>You will be given a String[] <b>board</b>, representing the game board. <b>board</b> will contain exactly one 'A' and exactly one 'B'; each other character will be either '.' (empty space), or 'X' (a wall). Your method should return the minimum number of turns necessary for players A and B to switch positions, or -1 if this is impossible.</p></td>
