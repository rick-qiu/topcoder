     <td>You have a page of text that is nicely formatted in the usual fashion (like this text), but you wanted it formatted in two columns, like a magazine. Given a String[] <b>text</b>, and an int <b>width</b>, return a String[] which is the same text but formatted such that every element contains as many words as possible without being more than <b>width</b> characters long. Begin by putting as many words as possible in the first line of the first column without using more than <b>width</b> characters, then continue this for each subsequent line. The elements of the return value should be organized such that every pair of elements corresponds to one line of text, spread over two columns. Thus element 2*<i>i</i> and 2*<i>i</i>+1 (with i starting at 0) of the output will represent the <i>i</i>-th line of the first and second columns, respectively. If the last line of the second column has no text, do not include it as part of the return value (see example 0). Do not hyphenate words to fit them on two lines. Also, there should only be a single space between adjacent words, and there should be no leading or trailing spaces in the lines. A 'word' is a sequence of non-space characters that does not have non-space characters immediately before or after it. Punctuation marks should be treated the same as other characters. For example, &quot;Hello,Fred&quot;, &quot;Hello,I'mFred&quot;, and &quot;...!?!?&quot; are all considered to be single words, and should not be broken apart in any way.<br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, if <b>text</b>={&quot;This text is now &quot;,&quot;in two columns.&quot;} and <b>width</b>=7, the output would be {&quot;This&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;text is&quot;, &quot;columns.&quot;, &quot;now in&quot;}. Making the first element of the return value the first line of the first column, the next element the first line of the second column, and then continuing in the same way for subsequent rows, the text looks like this: <pre>
&quot;This&quot;    &quot;two&quot;
&quot;text is&quot; &quot;columns.&quot;
&quot;now in&quot;
</pre></td>
