     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Market differentiation in its simplest form is a system of charging different prices to different customers for the same product. To maximize the total sales revenue, we would like to charge each customer individually, charging the highest price that that customer would be willing to pay. Usually we have to divide the customers into a few groups, and charge the same price to everyone in a group (e.g. business class, economy class, etc.). <p> We have a list of all the potential customers for our product and the most that each customer is willing to pay. We have decided to differentiate them into four or fewer (non-overlapping) groups. Everyone within each group will be offered the same price. Our goal is to choose the groups and prices optimally to maximize our total sales revenue. </p><p> Create a class Pricing that contains a method maxSales that takes a int[] <b>price</b> containing the highest price that each potential customer is willing to pay, and returns the maximum sales revenue we can generate by differentiating our customers into four or fewer groups. </p> </td>
