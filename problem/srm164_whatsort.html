     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>We have a sorted list of customer information. Each customer has an age, a weight, and a name. We want to determine the basis on which they were sorted. We believe that the customers were sorted based on alphabetical order of names, ascending order of ages, and descending order of weights. One of these fields was the primary field, used to initially sort the customers. Then one of these fields was used as the secondary field to break ties between customers that were indistinguishable based on the primary field. And finally the remaining field was used to break ties between customers that had the same values for their primary and secondary fields. <p> Create a class WhatSort that contains method sortType that is given a String[] <b>name</b>, a int[] <b>age</b>, and a int[] <b>wt</b> that gives the attributes of the customers. The first elements of <b>name</b>, <b>age</b>, and <b>wt</b> correspond to the first customer in the sorted list of customers, the second elements to the second customer, etc. Your method will return a String that tells what sort of sort was used: </p>
      <ol>
       <li> NAW -- name was the primary, age secondary, weight the final field</li>
       <li> NWA -- name was the primary, weight secondary, age final</li>
       <li> ANW -- age was primary, name was secondary, weight final</li>
       <li> AWN -- age was primary, weight was secondary, name final</li>
       <li> WAN -- weight primary, age secondary, name final</li>
       <li> WNA -- weight primary, name secondary, age final</li>
       <li> IND -- indeterminate: more than one of the above is possible</li>
       <li> NOT -- none of the above sorting methods was used</li>
