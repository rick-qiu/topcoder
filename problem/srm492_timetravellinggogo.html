     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Gogo lives in Rainyland and wants to attend a party. There are <b>N</b> houses in Rainyland, conveniently numbered 0 through <b>N</b>-1. Gogo lives in house 0 and the party is in house <b>N</b>-1. There are several bidirectional roads of various lengths that Gogo can traverse. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> It rains a lot in Rainyland. In fact, with the exception of several sunny intervals, it rains all the time. The i-th sunny interval starts at the beginning of minute <b>sunnyStart</b>[i] and ends at the beginning of minute <b>sunnyEnd</b>[i]. Gogo can't get his party clothes wet, so whenever it is raining, he must be inside a house. He can only traverse roads during sunny intervals. More exactly, if he starts traversing a road at the beginning of minute A and ends at the beginning of minute B, there must exist such i that <b>sunnyStart</b>[i] &lt;= A &lt; B &lt;= <b>sunnyEnd</b>[i]. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The roads are given in the String[] <b>roads</b>. Concatenate the elements of <b>roads</b> to get a single space separated list of roads. Each road is formatted &quot;a,b,travelcost&quot; (quotes for clarity), which means that the bidirectional road connects city a and city b, and requires travelcost minutes to traverse either way. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Gogo also has a time machine, which he can use to go back in time. He can only use the time machine inside a house, and it requires <b>machineStartTime</b> + X minutes to go back in time by X minutes. He can go back as far as time 0, but no further. For example, suppose the time is currently 100, <b>machineStartTime</b> is 10, and he wants to go back to time 80 because it was sunny then. It will take him 10 + 20 = 30 minutes to get back to time 80. Note that when he uses the time machine, his position will not change. In other words, he won't go back to where he happened to be at time 80 the last time he was there. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Gogo is initially in his house at the beginning of minute 0. Return the minimum number of minutes Gogo needs to reach house <b>N</b>-1 without getting wet. Return -1 if it's impossible. Note that Gogo does not have to be in constant motion. For example, he can wait inside a house while waiting for a sunny interval. Also, note that time travel does not affect Gogo's total time. For example, in the scenario described above, if he used the time machine for the first time at time 100, then when he goes back to time 80, his total time will be 130 minutes, not 80 minutes.</td>
