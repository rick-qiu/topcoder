     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Manao has recently invented a brand new game called The Number Game. He usually plays this game against his friend. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Initially, Manao has an integer <b>A</b> and his friend has an integer <b>B</b>. Note that neither <b>A</b> nor <b>B</b> contain a zero digit in their base 10 representation. The players make moves alternatively with Manao starting first. In each move, the player can either reverse his current number, or he can divide it by 10 (using integer division). For example, if the current number is 12849, the player can either reverse it to obtain 94821, or he can divide it by 10 to obtain 1284. Note that we always round <i>down</i> when using integer division. Also note that each player is only allowed to change his own number, and not the number of the other player. <br /><br /><br /><br /> If after some move the players' numbers become equal, Manao is declared the winner. If after 1000 moves (that is, 500 moves by Manao and 500 by his friend) Manao has not won, he loses. Given <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, determine whether Manao would win if both players play optimally. Return &quot;Manao wins&quot; or &quot;Manao loses&quot; accordingly.</td>
