     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>The Counting Game is a game played between two players. The first player starts counting at 1, and can say no more than <b>maxAdd</b> numbers. The second player continues counting from where the first player left off. The two players alternate, each one contributing at least one but no more than <b>maxAdd</b> numbers. The player who says the goal number is the winner. <p> For example, if <b>maxAdd</b> is 3 and the <b>goal</b> is 20, then a game (between bad players A and B) might go like this: </p><p> A: 1,2,3 ... B: 4,5 ... A: 6 ... B: 7,8,9 ... A: 10,11,12 ... B: 13 ... A: 14 ... B: 15,16 ... A: 17,18 ... B: 19,20 </p><p> Since player B said the goal number, she was the winner. </p><p> There is a perfect strategy for this game. When <b>maxAdd</b> is 3, if you end your turn by saying 16, then no matter whether your opponent contributes 1, 2, or 3 numbers you will be able to count to 20 on your next turn. Similarly, if you end your turn by saying 12, then no matter what your opponent does you can end your next turn by saying 16, and thus win on your following turn. </p><p> Create a class CountGame to help you play this game. It should contain a method howMany that is given <b>maxAdd</b>, the most numbers you may say on each turn, <b>goal</b>, the goal number, and <b>next</b>, the number that you must start counting on. The method should return how many numbers you should say. If there is no way for you to force a win, then the method should return -1. </p> </td>
