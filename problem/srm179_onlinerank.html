     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Proposals arrive at our office in a sequence. We give each one a score. We then calculate its &quot;rank&quot; based on comparison with the scores of the most recent submissions. Its rank is 1 + the number of recent scores that are greater than it. So a rank of 1 is the best possible rank and indicates that no recent score was greater. A rank of 2 would mean that exactly one recent score was greater. We need software that can calculate the rank of each score. <p> Create a class OnLineRank that contains a method calcRanks that is given <b>k</b>, the number of recent scores to use in each rank calculation, and int[] <b>scores</b>, the sequence of scores of the arriving proposals. The method should calculate the rank for each score and return the sum of all the ranks. </p><p> Each rank should be calculated based on the preceding <b>k</b> scores. If fewer than <b>k</b> scores have preceded this score, base the calculation on all the preceding scores. (The first proposal is thus guaranteed a rank of 1.) </p> </td>
