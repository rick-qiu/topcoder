     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>A certain professor has come up with two grading schemes. Each of his students has received a definite score in the course between 0 and 100 points, inclusive. The scores for all the students are given in the int[] <b>scores</b>, which will be sorted from least to greatest. Students will end up with an integer grade between 0 and 8 points. He has mentally assigned desired <b>grades</b> to each student. The i-th element of <b>scores</b> corresponds to the i-th element of <b>grades</b>. Grades corresponding to equal scores will be sorted greatest to least.<br /><br /><br /><br /> In the first scheme, if he desires a certain student to have a grade of X, then every student scoring as high or higher than that student must receive a grade of at least X. Aside from this constraint, students will be given the lowest possible grade. For example, suppose 3 students had scores of {60,80,80} and the professor desired them to have grades of {3,8,6}. They would then recieve grades of {3,8,8}, since the third student scored at least as high as the second.<br /><br /><br /><br /> In the second scheme, if he desires a certain student to have a grade of X, then every student scoring as low or lower than that student must receive a grade of at <i>most</i> X. Aside from this constraint, students will be given the <i>highest</i> possible grade. In the above example, the students would recieve grades of {3,6,6} now, since the second student scored at least as low as the third.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should apply both schemes, and for each student, determine the absolute difference between the final grades obtained from the two schemes. Return the sum of those differences.</td>
