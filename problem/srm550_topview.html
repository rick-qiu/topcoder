     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Ralph was once playing with a set of cards and a grid of cells. Each card was a rectangle of a unique color. Different cards may have had different dimensions. Ralph took his cards one at a time, and placed each of them onto the grid. When placing a card, Ralph aligned its sides with grid lines, so each card covered some rectangular block of cells. Some cards may have overlapped other, previously placed cards partially or even completely. Once all the cards were placed, on each cell only the topmost card was visible. You are given a String[] <b>grid</b> that describes what Ralph could see after placing the cards. The j-th character of element i of <b>grid</b> is '.' if the cell at position (i,j) is empty (does not contain any card) or is an alphanumeric character that represents the only color Ralph could see when looking at the cell.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Ralph does not remember the order he used to place the cards. Write a program that finds the order in which the cards of each visible color were placed. The return value should be a String, containing exactly once each of the alphanumeric characters that occur in <b>grid</b>. The i-th character of the return value should be the color of the i-th card (0-based index) that Ralph placed. In case there are multiple valid orders, return the lexicographically smallest one. In case there is no valid order of colors, return &quot;ERROR!&quot; (quotes for clarity).</td>
