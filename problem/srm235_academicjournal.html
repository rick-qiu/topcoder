     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td><p>In any field of research, there are many journals to which one can submit an article for publication. One criterion that is commonly used to choose between journals is the impact factor, a measure of the importance of a journal and the papers that are published there. The impact factor of a journal is defined as the average number of citations each paper in that journal receives from papers in other journals. Citations from papers in the same journal are not counted in order to prevent its editors from inflating their impact factor by preferentially accepting papers that cite other papers in their journal. Although impact factors are not a fair way to judge the quality of research, they do provide a quantitative method for comparing journals to each other.</p> <p>Write a class AcademicJournal with a method rankByImpact that takes a String[] <b>papers</b>, a collection of published papers from which to calculate impact factors, and returns a String[] with the journal names sorted in decreasing order by impact factor. Each element of <b>papers</b> contains the information for a single paper, and is formatted with the name of the paper's journal (consisting of only uppercase English characters and spaces), followed by a period, followed by zero or more integers specifying the zero-based indices of the papers it cites. The citation indices contain no extra leading zeroes, and are separated from each other and from the period character by single spaces. If there is a tie in the impact factors, the journal with more papers comes first in the return value. If there is still a tie, the journal with the lexicographically earlier name comes first.</p></td>
