     <td><p>Imagine a game consisting of two billion doors (numbered starting at 1), behind some of which lie fabulous cash prizes. There are a limited number of patterns to the placement of the prizes, which the contestant knows in advance. All doors initially begin closed. Before the game begins, the host secretly selects one of the patterns from the list at random (all with equal probability), and puts prizes behind the doors specified by the pattern. For example, if the host chose the pattern &quot;3-4 9 12-15&quot;, he would put prizes behind doors 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (and nowhere else).</p> <p>Two things happen every turn. First, the contestant decides which door is currently most likely to contain a prize, and secretly records this choice. (If two or more doors both have the greatest likelihood of containing a prize, he chooses the door with the lowest number.) The second part of a turn consists of the host opening one or more doors, all of which are revealed to be empty. For example, if the host gave the hint &quot;2 7-10&quot;, this would indicate that he opened doors 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10 and there were no prizes behind any of them.</p> <p>In specific, the following grammar is used for this problem:</p> <tt>&lt;doors&gt; ::= &lt;range&gt; | &lt;range&gt;&lt;sp&gt;&lt;doors&gt;<br /><br /> &lt;range&gt; ::= &lt;num&gt; | &lt;num&gt;&lt;to&gt;&lt;num&gt; </tt> (the first <i>num</i> must be strictly less than the second <i>num</i>)<tt><br /><br /> &lt;num&gt; ::= integer between 1 and 2000000000, inclusive, with no leading zeroes<br /><br /> &lt;sp&gt; ::= ' '<br /><br /> &lt;to&gt; ::= '-'</tt> <p>Given a String[] <b>possible</b>, containing the possible placements of prizes, and a String[] <b>hints</b>, the <tt>N</tt> hints given during the course of the game, your method should return a int[] containing <tt>N+1</tt> elements. Each element should describe the most likely position of a prize at that point in the game. The first element represents your guess before any hints are given; the last element represents your guess taking every hint into account. Remember to break ties by choosing the lowest numbered door, if multiple doors are all the most likely.</p></td>

Doors 100 and 200 are the most likely, so your first guess should be 100 (since it is smaller).</p> <p>Then the host reveals that there are no prizes behind doors 50-75. Pattern &quot;1-100&quot; is now no longer an option. You now know for sure that there is a prize in door 200, whereas the odds for any other door 100-300 is only 1/2. Therefore, 200 is the second element of the return list.</p> <p>Finally, the host opens doors 250-1000 and shows them all to be empty.
