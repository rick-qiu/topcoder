     <td> <p> You are developing the matchmaking component of an online dating site. Prospective members must fill out a questionnaire consisting of binary questions such as <i>Do you prefer to vacation (<b>a</b>) in the mountains or (<b>b</b>) at the seaside?</i> and <i>Would you rather travel (<b>a</b>) by plane or (<b>b</b>) by train?</i> </p> <p> You are to match up men with women by maximizing the number of answers each couple has in common. A man and a woman have an answer in common whenever they give the same answer to the same question. Conflicts can easily arise due to numerical ties, but you will be able to resolve all such conflicts using the following procedure. Note that there will be equal numbers of men and women, with names being unique in each sex. </p> <p> Take the woman whose name comes earliest in lexicographic order, and consider the men with whom she has the greatest number of answers in common. Among these men, pick the one whose name comes earliest in lexicographic order. You have found the woman's best match. Remove this couple from the dating pool, and repeat the matching procedure until there are no more singles left. </p> <p> You are given a String[], <b>namesWomen</b>, containing the names of single women, and another String[], <b>answersWomen</b>, containing their answers. The <i>k</i>th element of <b>answersWomen</b> lists the answers of the woman whose name is the <i>k</i>th element of <b>namesWomen</b>. If there are <i>n</i> questions in the questionnaire, then every element of <b>answersWomen</b> consists of <i>n</i> characters, each of which is either 'a' or 'b'. The answers are always given in the fixed questionnaire order. You are similarly given the String[]s <b>namesMen</b> and <b>answersMen</b> for the single men. Lastly, you are given a String, <b>queryWoman</b>, containing the name of a woman. Return the name of the man to whom she is matched after you have formed all couples according to the above rules. </p> </td>
