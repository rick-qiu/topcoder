     <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>The game of Errant Knights is played on an infinite chessboard using two knights, white and black. The players alternate turns and the white player starts the game. Each player makes a normal chess knight's move with his knight, but there is a restriction that each move must make the Euclidean distance between the two knights smaller. A player can make more than one move in a single turn, but then each move must go in the same direction.<br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, if the black knight is at coordinates (0, 0) and the white knight is at (9, 5), then the white knight can move to (7, 4), (5, 3), (3, 2), (1, 1), (-1, 0). Further moving in this direction is not allowed because (-3, -1) is further from (0, 0) than (-1, 0). Of course, the white knight could also start his turn by moving in one of several other directions, and then possibly making more moves in that direction.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The game ends when one of the knights wins by capturing the other one (by moving to its position), or when it is impossible to make another move (because the knights are orthogonally next to each other and each move would increase the distance). In the second case, the player who should make the next move loses.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Several games of Errant Knight will be played. The starting position of the white knight in the <b>i</b>-th game is (<b>x[i]</b>, <b>y[i]</b>). The black knight will start each game at (0, 0). Both players play optimally. Return a String where the i-th character is <tt>'B'</tt> if the black knight wins the <b>i</b>-th game or <tt>'W'</tt> if the white knight wins. </td>
